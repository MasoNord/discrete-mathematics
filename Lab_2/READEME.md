# Theme

Reflection properties.

# Target

Familiarize yourself with the properties of reflections and their study.

# Plan

1. Make a program that, as input, obtains two finite sets and the correspondence between the elements
of these sets and examines whether this correspondence is a mapping (correctly given).
2. Make a program that receives two finite sets as input and sets the mapping from one to another with given properties (injectivity, surjectivity, bijectivity).
