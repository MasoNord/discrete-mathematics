# Topic

Spanning tree 

# Target

Familiarization with the Prima algorithm for constructing a bone tree of extreme (minimum or maximum) weight for an arbitrary finite undirected connected graph.

# Plan
The task of the work is to create a program that implements the Prim (nearest neighbor) algorithm
for finding a bone tree of extreme (largest or smallest) weight for an arbitrary finite undirected connected graph.
