# Introduction
Methodological guidelines for laboratory work are compiled in accordance with the curriculum for the discipline "Discrete Mathematics" and contain five laboratory works.
The implementation of laboratory work is aimed at mastering the basic concepts of discrete mathematics, programmatically implementing them.

In laboratory work 1, the basic concepts from the section of elements of set theory are investigated.
In laboratory work 2 we examine the properties of reflections, and in laboratory work 3 âˆ’ the properties of relations.
In laboratory work 4, we consider the Prima algorithm for constructing a bone tree of a connected graph.
Laboratory work 5 is devoted to the issue of coloring graphs..

The result of the work is also the acquisition by the student of the knowledge and skills necessary to perform the calculated graphic work.
In laboratory works, the computer technology available at the department is used.
Methodological instructions will help the student to learn the material of the discipline, to obtain the necessary skills in
the programmatic implementation of the basic concepts of discrete mathematics, to complete the task of calculating graphic work in time.

Concepts from set theory are the basis for all mathematics.
Concepts from abstract algebra are now widely used in applied applications, in particular in protecting information from an attacker (cryptology)
and from interference (noise-resistant coding). Concepts from graph theory are also widely used.
