# Topic

Correct coloring of graphs.

# Target

Familiarize yourself with the correct coloring of graphs using a heuristic algorithm.

# Plan

The task of the work is to create a program that implements a heuristic algorithm for correct coloring for an arbitrary finite undirected graph without loops.
