# Topic

Relationship properties.

# Target

Get acquainted with the properties of relationships and their study.

# Plan
1. Make a program that as input receives a finite set with n > 30 elements and the ratio given on it and examines its properties (reflectivity, symmetry, transitivity).
2. Make a program that as input receives a finite set with n > 30 elements and sets on it a relation with given properties (reflectivity, symmetry, transitivity).
The number of pairs of elements of the initial set that belong to the relation must be no less than ${n} ^ {3/2}$.
